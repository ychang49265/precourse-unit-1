# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE!!!

## Please Read Everything Before Proceeding...

Welcome to the Codesmith Precourse.

This precourse is designed to help you become experienced in the fundamental JavaScript concepts. Many of the challenges may be familiar, especially in the first portion, but please be patient since a large final project awaits in which you will utilize all your JavaScript skills. Part 1 of the precourse is designed to solidify your basics in JavaScript.

This precourse will truly help you understand the core material and get you ready for our full time program. Plus, it is a great opportunity for you to show us that you can handle our rigorous curriculum.

If this is challenging, don't be worried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you throughout the Codesmith program and your entire development career.

## Setting up your dev environment

Before you begin working on the precourse, please read through the instructions linked below, which will guide you through setting up your dev environment, installing all necessary software, and becoming familiar with resources you'll use throughout the immersive program and your career as a software engineer.

[Environment setup instructions](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/dev-environment-setup)

Once you have everything set up, proceed on to the precourse challenges!

## How do I get started?
- After you've reviewed the setup instructions and installed everything you'll need, fork and clone this Repository (review [You Need To Know How To Use Github!](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/dev-environment-setup#you-need-to-know-how-to-use-github) to learn how to fork and clone repositories)

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided part 1 of the precourse challenges into three different levels. Each level has its own folder. Each folder consists of four items (ignore any other files/folders or items you see):

- Skill Builder File ("README.md")
- Source Folder ("src")
- Test Folder ("test")
- Index File ("index.html")

You will only modify the codes inside the "main.js" file located in the source ("src") folder. **MAKE SURE TO READ ALL COMMENTS** inside the "main.js" file; these will be your instructions for solving each problem. DO NOT CHANGE anything in any other files or folders. You may take a look at the test folder to inquire how we are testing the correctness of the challenges. After you are done with each challenge open the index file (index.html) on the browser (Chrome or Firefox) to display the test results. For incorrect results, a red "x mark" will display beside the test that did not pass and for correct results, a green "check mark" will display beside the test that passed. We encourage you to look at the displayed error message; it will help you figure out what you might need to fix.

The Skill Builder File provides resources to instruct you on these challenges if needed. **Read the README files if you get stuck.**

#### Checkout The Skill Builders For Each Level:

- [Beginner Level](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-part-1/blob/master/Level-1-Beginner/README.md)
- [Intermediate Level](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-part-1/blob/master/Level-2-Intermediate/README.md)
- [Advanced Level](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-part-1/blob/master/Level-3-Advanced/README.md)
